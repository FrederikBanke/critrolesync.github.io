# CritRoleSync

This is a simple, unofficial web app that helps you switch back and forth
between the [Critical Role](https://critrole.com) podcast and YouTube videos.
It can also take you directly to the appropriate point in the episode
transcript.

Listening to the podcast but want to see the map Matt just pulled out? Need to
switch to audio for your daily commute? This app exists to make these tasks
easier.

Given your current playback position in one medium, it will calculate the
corresponding time in the other, accounting for differences caused by the
mid-session break, altered introductions, and variable playback rate.
